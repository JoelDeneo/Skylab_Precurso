                        <p>
                            Superman is a famous comic book character. He may be the first modern superhero
                            character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were
                            still in high school. He first appeared in Action Comics issue #1 in 1938. Later,
                            he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and
                            radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes and is in the DC
                            Comics.[source?] As an amazing superhero he does not kill anyone. But when he
                            killed General Zod he had a breakdown. Like other characters in the DC Universe,
                            there have been several alternative versions of Superman over the years. Several
                            actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud
                            Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom
                            Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin.

                        <p>
                            Batman is a fictional superhero appearing 
                            in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
                            The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer 
                            Bill Finger,[2][3] and first appeared in Detective Comics #27 
                            in 1939. Originally named the "Bat-Man," the character is also 
                            referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, 
                            and the World's Greatest Detective. Batman's secret identity is Bruce 
                            Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner 
                            of Wayne Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in 
                            Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents 
                            Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against 
                            criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains 
                            himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired 
                            persona to fight crime.[7]

                        <p>
                            Aquaman (Arthur Curry) is a fictional superhero appearing in 
                            American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul 
                            Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun 
                            Comics #73 (November 1941).[1] Initially a backup feature in 
                            DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes 
                            of a solo comic book series. During the late 1950s' and 1960s' 
                            superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a 
                            founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s' Modern Age, 
                            writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with 
                            storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis.
                            [2] The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a 
                            lasting impression, making Aquaman widely recognized in popular 
                            culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes.
